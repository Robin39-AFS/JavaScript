// Here we learn JS Engine JavaScript RunTime Environment

// In JS runtime enviorment have js engine, api, callback Q, microtask Q and event loop and so many thing.

// check img engine1 and 2 there have something then JIT compilation is just in time

// Here in first on the javascript engine was use interpretter but now a day in mordern js engine use both interpretter plus compiler and we know what is both as it use both then it call JIT comoilation.

// some js engine use AOT is Ahead of time. in there compiler take code and which is going to be executed later and tries to optimize it as much as can then convert to byte code and that is go to execution.

// in the execution can not done with out two major thing one is memory heap and anohter is call stack.

// if we want to learn about garbage collector then we have to study Mark and sweep algorithm. GC is communicate with memory heap to free the memory.
